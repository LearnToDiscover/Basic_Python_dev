    "The ```enumerate()``` function actually returns a *generator* of ```tuple``` items each time it is called in the context of a ```for``` loop. A generator is in principle very similar to a normal array; however, unlike an array, the values of a generator are not evaluated by the computer until the exact time at which they are going to be used. This is an important technique in functional programming known as *lazy evaluation*. It is primarily utilised to reduce the workload on the computer (both the processor and the memory) by preventing the execution of processes that may be delayed for a later time. In the case of the ```enumerate()``` function, the values are evaluated at the beginning of each iteration cycle in a ```for``` loop. Learn more about lazy evaluation in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) or read more on generators in Python in the [official documentations](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html\\#generators).\n",
