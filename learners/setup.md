## Python 3
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
It is sometimes claimed that biologist should use Python 2, because most biology related libraries in Python are written for that version. This is wrong. The reason why Python 2 is still out there is that following the release of Python 3.0 in December 2008, the CPython interpreter sustained several problems, and was not backward compatible. This meant that, any code written in Python 2, could *not* be run using Python 3 without modifications. By now, Python 2 is obsolete. Do not use it.

## Why Anaconda?
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
For the purpose of this course, we recommend the Anaconda distribution of Python released by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/), and maintained by the [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/).
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>	
Anaconda automatically installs many package needed for scientific purposes (over 720 open source packages). It is easy to install, and it takes care of al dependencies between packages. This is particularly important because some of Python's scientific libraries have Fortran-- and C--based dependencies, which may be challenging to install for beginners.

## Installation
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
To install the Anaconda distribution of Python, please visit the [installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) as outlined in the Anaconda documentations, and follow the instructions for your operating system. Ensure that you use the Python 3.x graphical installer for Windows and MacOSX (there is no graphical installer for Linux). Once downloaded, you can proceed to install the distribution as you would any other application on your computer.
