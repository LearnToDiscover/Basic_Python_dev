Additionally, Python 3 disallows the mixing of **tab** and **space** indentations. Some Python IDEs such as *PyCharm* automatically convert ```Tab``` indentations to 4 spaces. Some other IDEs (e.g. Jupyter) typically highlight ```Tab``` indentations to explicitly distinguish them and thereby notify the programmer of their existence. However, more often than not, IDEs and text editors tend to *ignore* this, which amounts to inconsistencies and subsequently ```IndentationError```. This is a very common difficulty that new Python programmers face, and can be very confusing if not handled correctly. \n",
